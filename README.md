# Noise-free Latent Block Model (NFLBM)

This repository includes the prototype R codes for running the NFLB  and the datasets described in : 
*Noise-free Latent Block Model for High Dimensional Data*, C. Laclau and V. Brault 
Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2018.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It contains the followings folders l
- data --  pre-processed datasets used for experiments the  Noise Free Latent Block Model (NFLBM)
- prog --  codes (in R) of different versions of the NFLBM (VBayes, Gibbs), the ICL-based selection procedure.  
- Launch_me.R -- an example for running the different algorithms on a simulated dataset.
